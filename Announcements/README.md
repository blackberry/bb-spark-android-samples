# BBM Enterprise SDK Android Announcements Sample

This directory contains sample code for an example Announcements app that
demonstrates how a user can post announcements as custom messages in a chat.
The sample demonstrates how the 
[Chat Message References](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/references.html)
feature of the SDK can be used to edit an announcement and view the edit history.

This example builds on the [SimpleChat](../SimpleChat/README.md) and utilizes the
the
[Support module](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/examples/android/Support/README.html) 
to quickly create a basic chat application. This example also uses the Android
[RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview.html).
