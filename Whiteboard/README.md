# BBM Enterprise SDK Android Whiteboard Sample

This directory contains sample code for a shared whiteboard application.
The app demonstrations how you can share arbitrary data in a BBM Enterprise
SDK chat. This example builds on the [Quick Start](../QuickStart/README.md) example that
demonstrates how you can authenticate with the BBM Enterprise SDK using the [Identity Provider](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/identityManagement.html) 
of your application.
