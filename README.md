# BBM Enterprise SDK
The BBM Enterprise SDK is an IP-based cloud communications platform that lets 
you easily create powerful new experiences between your users, machines and IoT 
devices. Its enterprise-grade communication and data sharing functionality can 
be integrated directly into your Android, iOS and web apps.
With end-to-end encryption, digitally signed messages, and guaranteed data 
delivery, the BBM Enterprise SDK is a secure CPaaS (communications platform as a 
service) solution that can enable you to build powerful connections 
around the world, while keeping everything safe and secure in a 
“private garden” communication system.
