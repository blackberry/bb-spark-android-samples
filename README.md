# BlackBerry Spark Communications Services
Spark is an IP-based cloud communications platform that lets
you easily create powerful new experiences between your users, machines, and IoT
devices. Its enterprise-grade communication and data sharing functionality can
be integrated directly into your Android, iOS and web apps.
With end-to-end encryption, digitally signed messages, and guaranteed data
delivery, Spark is a secure CPaaS (communications platform as a
service) solution that can enable you to build powerful connections
around the world, while keeping everything safe and secure in a
“private garden” communication system.
